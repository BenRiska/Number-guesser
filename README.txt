Welcome to Bens Number Guesser Game/App.
*Version 1.0.0*

This script allows you to guess a number between 1-10, if correct you will be notified with a green border. If incorrect you will be prompted to try again, if you fail 3 times you lose and will be given the option to play again.

The UI was made with the skeleton framework, feel free to use this in your own projects.

Why did i make this app?
To get a better understanding of vanilla javascript and familiarise myself with the methodology behind commonly used functions.
